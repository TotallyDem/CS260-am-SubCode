A bag of marbles can be created as an assorted list of objects.

When we pull out an item from the list that constitutes our bag we use a random number function to grab one of the marbles. We then simultaneously remove that item from the list

To add a marble to the bag we can extend the length of the list by 1 and append the new marble to the end.

For the sake of this assignment let's say that “red” represents a red marble, “green” represents a green marble, and “blue” represents a blue marble.

In order to see if adding a marble goes correctly we could create a function that counts the marbles one by one to see the total count of each type. By going through all of the indexes of the list. We could then run said function to get a before count and then add a marble, run the function again and get an after count. Alternatively, we could just print the whole list to the console and look through it manually.
